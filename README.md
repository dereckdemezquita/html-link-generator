# node-html-link-generator

Quick and dirty programme for generating some HTML to display images. Tried some built in npm packages; they are broken.

## Description

Made this for working on my website, which directly write in HTML. I sometimes want to include a bunch of images. I just want to dump them.

## Use

Set the `rootPath` in the `index.js`, create a directory named images and dump your images there. Finally run the programme with `node .` command.
